# Application of Ant Colony Optimisation Algorithm to the Bin Packing Problem

The Bin Packing Problem is an NP-hard problem with many potential applications. Being NP-hard, there is no known optimal algorithm for BPP running in polynomial time. This project was aimed to discuss various nature-inspired algorithms that have been applied to the Bin Packing problem and analyze results from an Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO).

This repo provides a research paper and the code for Ant-Colony solution.
